[JAMES OLYMPIA nods and waves to the audience]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we're going to talk about something that I know will excite all of you nerds out there. That's right, Dungeons and Dragons!

[JAMES OLYMPIA leans back and folds his arms behind his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: The latest installment, "Honor Among Thieves," has just made a whopping $72 million dollars in its global debut. That's a lot of gold pieces, folks.

[JAMES OLYMPIA puts his hand on his heart]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I know what you're thinking. "James, why are you talking about a game that's been around since before you were born?" Well, my dear audience, let me tell you why. Because this game is still relevant today, and it's making more money than ever before.

[JAMES OLYMPIA shakes his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's right, folks. Dungeons and Dragons is not just for basement-dwelling nerds anymore. It's for everyone! And with this new movie, it's going to be bigger than ever.

[JAMES OLYMPIA folds his arms across his chest]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I know some of you may be skeptical. You may be thinking, "James, how can a movie about a game where people sit around a table and roll dice be any good?" Well, let me tell you, my dear audience, this movie is going to be epic.

[JAMES OLYMPIA laughs track is played]

JAMES OLYMPIA: And with that, we come to the end of our segment. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.
