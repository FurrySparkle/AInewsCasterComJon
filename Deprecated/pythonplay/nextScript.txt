[JAMES OLYMPIA nods and waves to the audience]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we're going to talk about something that I know will excite all of you nerds out there. That's right, Dungeons and Dragons!

[JAMES OLYMPIA leans back and folds his arms behind his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Dungeons and Dragons has been around for a while, but it's actually experiencing a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially among younger generations. And the entire franchise has made an estimated $72 million dollars, not just the latest installment.

[JAMES OLYMPIA puts his hand on his heart]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I know what you're thinking. "James, why are you talking about a game that's been around since before you were born?" Well, my dear audience, let me tell you why. Because this game is still relevant today, and it's making more money than ever before.

[JAMES OLYMPIA shakes his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's right, folks. Dungeons and Dragons is not just for basement-dwelling nerds anymore. It's for everyone! And with the new movie, it has the potential to be bigger than ever.

[JAMES OLYMPIA folds his arms across his chest]

JAMES OLYMPIA: While we can't say how good the movie will be, we can talk about the star-studded cast and the potential for it to be a box office hit. We should also mention the impact that Dungeons and Dragons has had on pop culture, inspiring countless movies, TV shows, and even video games. And let's not forget about the emotional connection that many people have with the game, and how it's helped them through difficult times. Plus, the inclusivity that the game promotes, allowing people of all backgrounds and identities to come together and have fun.

[JAMES OLYMPIA laughs track is played]

JAMES OLYMPIA: And with that, we come to the end of our segment. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.
