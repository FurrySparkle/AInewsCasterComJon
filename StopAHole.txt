[The writers' room falls silent for a moment as they read through the script]

Willy Newton: James, I think we need to add some scientific context to this story. Perhaps we could mention the effects of social media on mental health and decision making?

Action Jackman: I agree with Willy. We should also include some actionable advice for our viewers on how to use social media responsibly.

Miss Jessica Penguin: And we should add some information on how Twitter is working to combat hate speech and misinformation.

Marry Hadda Littlelamb: I think we also need to consider the emotional impact of the shooting on the victims and their families. We should be careful not to trivialize their experiences.

Lil' Smoke: And we need to add some humor to lighten the mood. Maybe we could make a joke about the governor's representative being a 'tweetaholic'?

James Olympia: Great suggestions, everyone. Let's get to work on incorporating these edits into the script. And Lil' Smoke, I like the 'tweetaholic' joke. Let's definitely include that.
