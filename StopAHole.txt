[DIANE GNOSIS interrupts]

DIANE GNOSIS: James, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to fact-check this story before we air it. Can we hold off on broadcasting until I can verify the accuracy of these claims?

JAMES OLYMPIA: Of course, Diane. Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we go on air. Tony, can you double-check our sources and make sure we have all the details correct?

TONY BANSYA: On it, James.

[The team begins to work on verifying the story and editing the script accordingly.]
