[JAMES OLYMPIA waves to the camera]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we're talking about America's favorite pastime, baseball! [JAMES nods]

Now, I know what you're thinking, "James, you're a Brit, what do you know about baseball?" Well, let me tell you, I know just as much as any other Brit, which is to say, not a whole lot. [JAMES opens his arms]

But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the highlights and moments of MLB Opening Day! [JAMES shakes his head]

Let's start with the New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays. The Yankees won 3-2, but what I really want to talk about is this amazing catch by Yankees outfielder, Aaron Judge. [JAMES leans back]

[JAMES puts his hand on his heart]

Now, that's what I call a catch! And speaking of catches, how about this one by the San Francisco Giants' Mike Yastrzemski? [JAMES nods]

I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous! [JAMES laughs track is played]

And let's not forget about the Los Angeles Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, who became the first pitcher in MLB history to record 10 strikeouts on Opening Day three times. [JAMES folds his arms behind his head]

Now that's what I call a record! [JAMES shakes his head]

Moving on, we want to address the controversy surrounding the Texas Rangers' decision to allow full capacity at their stadium during the pandemic. While some fans were excited to return to the ballpark, others expressed concern over the potential health risks.

And let's not forget the new uniforms that some teams are wearing this season, like the Miami Marlins and the San Diego Padres. These fresh looks are sure to turn heads on the field.

Finally, we have to talk about the Chicago Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs won 5-3, but what everyone's talking about is this incredible home run by Cubs first baseman, Anthony Rizzo. [JAMES nods]

[JAMES leans back]

Now, that's what I call a home run! [JAMES puts his hand on his heart]

And let's take a moment to acknowledge the emotional tribute by the Washington Nationals, who unveiled their new "W" logo in honor of their late manager, Walter "Walt" Weiss.

And that's it for our MLB Opening Day highlights and moments. [JAMES folds his arms across his chest] I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday!
