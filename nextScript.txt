JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we have some news from Arizona, where the Governor's representative has resigned over a tweet. 

[JAMES OLYMPIA shakes his head and leans back slightly]

JAMES OLYMPIA: The tweet in question referred to the perpetrators of the recent Nashville shooting as 'transphobes'. This tweet sparked outrage on social media, and the representative has since resigned.
