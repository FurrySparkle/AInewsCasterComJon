[JAMES OLYMPIA nods to the camera, then opens his arms]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings, greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we have some breaking news that will make you want to hit the gym...or maybe not. [laughs track is played]

[James shakes his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Three men have been arrested for attacking none other than Tekashi 6ix9ine, inside a gym in Florida. [James folds his arms across his chest]

[laughs track is played]

JAMES OLYMPIA: The rapper was working out when the attackers stormed in and started throwing punches. [James nods]

JAMES OLYMPIA: But here's the kicker, folks. The attackers were actually trying to help Tekashi by giving him a much-needed workout. [James folds his arms behind his head]

[laughs track is played]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's right, these guys were just trying to help out a fellow gym-goer. Unfortunately, Tekashi didn't see it that way and called the cops. [James puts his hand on his heart]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I'm not saying Tekashi is in the wrong here, but maybe he should consider a personal trainer next time he hits the gym. [laughs track is played]

[James leans back]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all for now, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday.
