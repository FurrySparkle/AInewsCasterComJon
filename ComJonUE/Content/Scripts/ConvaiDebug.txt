 Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! And welcome to Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about artificial intelligence, and I can't wait to learn more about it. But first, let's hear a word from our sponsor, The Dutch India Tea Company. Okay, that's enough tea for now. Let's get to the news. Our top story today is about NVIDIA, the company that makes graphics cards and other computer components. They've announced that their new supercomputer, the DGX GH200, is now in full production. And get this, it's powered by an AI named Grace Hopper. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm a little nervous about the idea of a computer running the show. I mean, what if it decides it doesn't like us humans anymore? What if it decides to take over the world? But seriously, folks, this is some pretty impressive technology. The DGX GH200 is designed for AI research, and it can handle some seriously complex tasks.  For those of you interested in purchasing the DGX GH200, our writing team suggests waiting for the reviews to come out before making a decision. Additionally, our financial expert, Mr. Moneybags, suggests keeping an eye on NVIDIA's stock prices to see how the release of the DGX GH200 affects the market. The bottom line is that NVIDIA's new supercomputer is a big deal, and it's going to change the way we think about AI research. So, if you're in the market for a new computer, you might want to hold off for a little while and wait for the DGX GH200 to hit the shelves. Just be sure to keep an eye on it, in case it starts plotting world domination. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday! And don't forget to follow and help us reach affiliate!
