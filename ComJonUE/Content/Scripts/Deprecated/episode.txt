JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! Welcome to "Yesterday Today," the news show where we take yesterday's news and turn it into today's comedy. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.



JAMES OLYMPIA: In international news, Russia has agreed to extend the Ukraine grain deal again. This humanitarian agreement allows Ukraine to ship food and fertilizer through a corridor from Black Sea ports. Oh, Russia, always extending things, like their borders and their hands for more vodka.



JAMES OLYMPIA: But seriously, folks, this deal is important. It's good to see countries working together to help each other out. Just like my co-workers take turns taking home our company pug, Mr. Scruffles.



JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, our science editor Willy Newton loves to interject factoids into the script, so here's one for you. Did you know that grain has been cultivated by humans for over 10,000 years? It's true! And it's still going strong, just like our love for Mr. Scruffles.



JAMES OLYMPIA: But let's get back to the news. The duration of this extension is uncertain, which makes me wonder if it'll last as long as that old jar of tea bags in the back of my cupboard.



JAMES OLYMPIA: But all jokes aside, we're glad to see progress being made in Ukraine. And we're especially glad that we have our culture editor, Lil' Smoke, who makes sure our jokes don't cross any cultural lines.



JAMES OLYMPIA: And that's all the time we have for today. Remember to be kind to one another, and if you see Mr. Scruffles on the street, give him a pat on the head for us. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.
