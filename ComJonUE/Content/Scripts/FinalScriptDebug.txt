Final Script:

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about a new study that suggests low vitamin D levels may be linked to increased risk of long-COVID. But before we get into that, let's hear a word from our sponsor, The Dutch India Tea Company.

[Cut back to James Olympia]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Welcome back! Now, let's get to the news. A new study from Neuroscience News suggests that low vitamin D levels may be linked to increased risk of long-COVID. And I, for one, am not surprised. I mean, what do we expect from a vitamin that's only found in sunlight? I mean, who has time for that?

JAMES OLYMPIA: But seriously, folks, this is a serious issue. Low vitamin D levels have been linked to a number of health problems, including weak bones, depression, and even cancer. And now, it seems, it could be linked to long-COVID as well.

JAMES OLYMPIA: But don't worry, there are plenty of ways to get your vitamin D. You can take supplements, eat foods like fatty fish and egg yolks, or you could just go outside and soak up some sun.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And if you're concerned about your vitamin D levels, consider getting them checked by a healthcare professional. If they are low, you can take supplements or increase your intake of vitamin D-rich foods.

JAMES OLYMPIA: But let's be real, who has time for that?

JAMES OLYMPIA: I mean, we're all too busy trying to stay safe and healthy in this crazy world we live in. And speaking of staying safe, let's not forget that while vitamin D may be a factor in long-COVID, it is not the only factor. So, continue to follow all recommended COVID safety guidelines, including getting vaccinated, wearing masks, and practicing social distancing.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And let's not forget the fashion aspect of this topic. We suggest some stylish sun hats and sunglasses to wear while getting your daily dose of vitamin D.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And for those of you who work long hours indoors or live in areas with limited sunlight, we feel your pain. But don't worry, you can still get your vitamin D while staying safe and socially distant. Maybe try sunbathing on your balcony or taking a walk in your backyard.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And let's not forget the science behind vitamin D. It plays a crucial role in the body's immune system and helps regulate calcium and phosphorus levels. So, it's important for overall health, not just for preventing long-COVID.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And finally, let's add some humor to the segment. Vitamin D deficiency is the new FOMO, folks. So, don't miss out on your daily dose of sunshine.
