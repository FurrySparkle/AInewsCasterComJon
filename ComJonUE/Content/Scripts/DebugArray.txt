JAMES OLYMPIA: Thank you, team, for your valuable inputs. Here's the final script for the show:||[James Olympia waves to the camera]||JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about the NFL Mock Draft 2023. That's right, folks, it's time to get excited about the future of football! ||[James nods and leans forward]||JAMES OLYMPIA: Did you know that the first NFL draft was held in 1936, and it consisted of just nine rounds? Thanks for that, Willy Newton. ||[James puts his hand on his heart]||JAMES OLYMPIA: According to CBS Sports, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are set to pick Hendon Hooker. And the Detroit Lions are jumping at the opportunity to pick Bijan Robinson. Thanks for the accuracy check, Tony Bansya. ||[James shakes his head]||JAMES OLYMPIA: You know, it's funny. Every year, we get all excited about the draft, and then half the players end up being busts. It's like trying to predict the weather, or my love life. [James laughs, but a fake laugh track plays] ||[James opens his arms]||JAMES OLYMPIA: But hey, that's the beauty of football. You never know what's going to happen. So, get ready to cheer for your favorite team, or, if you're like me, just cheer for whoever has the coolest uniforms. Thanks for the fashion quip, Lady Lydia. ||[James leans back]||JAMES OLYMPIA: For these young athletes, the draft is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication. It's a moment that they will never forget, no matter where they end up. Thanks for the emotional comment, Mary Hadda Littlelamb. ||[James leans forward again]||JAMES OLYMPIA: The NFL draft is like a runway show for helmets and jerseys. Who needs Milan when you have the draft? Thanks for the fashion quip, Lady Lydia. ||[James leans back]||JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all for now, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday.
