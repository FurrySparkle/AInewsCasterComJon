[James Olympia waves to the camera]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about the NFL Mock Draft 2023. That's right, folks, it's time to get excited about the future of football! 

[James nods and leans forward]

JAMES OLYMPIA: According to CBS Sports, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are set to pick Hendon Hooker. I mean, come on, with a name like that, he's destined for greatness! [James puts his hand on his heart] And the Detroit Lions are jumping at the opportunity to pick Bijan Robinson. I don't know who that is, but I assume he's good, because the Lions need all the help they can get. 

[James shakes his head]

JAMES OLYMPIA: You know, it's funny. Every year, we get all excited about the draft, and then half the players end up being busts. It's like trying to predict the weather, or my love life. [James laughs, but a fake laugh track plays] 

[James opens his arms]

JAMES OLYMPIA: But hey, that's the beauty of football. You never know what's going to happen. So, get ready to cheer for your favorite team, or, if you're like me, just cheer for whoever has the coolest uniforms. [James folds his arms across his chest]

[James leans back]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all for now, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday.
