JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about an outbreak of a rare fungal disease that's sickened dozens of mill workers in Michigan. Now, I know what you're thinking, "James, why are you talking about this? This isn't funny!" But let me tell you, this story is full of laughs.

[James takes a sip of tea and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: According to Gizmodo, the workers at the mill were exposed to a fungus called Blastomyces, which can cause flu-like symptoms, pneumonia, and even death. But here's the funny part, folks: the workers didn't even know they were sick until they started showing symptoms! [James laughs and shakes his head.] Classic!

[James takes another sip of tea and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I know what you're thinking, "James, how could this happen? Who's to blame?" Well, folks, it turns out the mill was using contaminated wood chips to power their boilers. That's right, they were burning fungus-infected wood chips! [James shakes his head.] I mean, who does that? [James pauses for a moment and looks at the camera.] Actually, don't answer that.

[James takes another sip of tea and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: But here's the real kicker, folks: the mill workers weren't the only ones affected by this outbreak. According to Gizmodo, a group of teenagers who were exploring an abandoned mill nearby also got sick. [James chuckles.] I mean, talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time!

[James takes another sip of tea and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: So, what's the takeaway from all of this, folks? Well, for one, don't burn contaminated wood chips. [James pauses for a moment and looks at the camera.] And two, always wear a mask when exploring abandoned mills. [James puts on a surgical mask.] Safety first, folks!

[James takes a final sip of tea and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all the time we have for this segment, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.
