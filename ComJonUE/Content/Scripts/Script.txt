JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! And welcome to Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we're talking about artificial intelligence, and I can't wait to learn more about it. But first, let's hear a word from our sponsor, The Dutch India Tea Company.

JAMES OLYMPIA: Okay, that's enough tea for now. Let's get to the news. Our top story today is about NVIDIA, the company that makes graphics cards and other computer components. They've announced that their new supercomputer, the DGX GH200, is now in full production. And get this, it's powered by an AI named Grace Hopper.

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I don't know about you, but I'm a little nervous about the idea of a computer running the show. I mean, what if it decides it doesn't like us humans anymore? What if it decides to take over the world? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to bow down to our new robot overlords just yet.

JAMES OLYMPIA: But seriously, folks, this is some pretty impressive technology. The DGX GH200 is designed for AI research, and it can handle some seriously complex tasks. It's like having a whole team of supercomputers at your disposal, all working together to solve the toughest problems.

JAMES OLYMPIA: And let's not forget about Grace Hopper, the AI that's powering this thing. She's named after a famous computer scientist, and she's apparently really good at what she does. But let's be honest, folks, she's no match for Mr. Scruffles, the pug that we all share custody of here at Yesterday Today. That little guy is a genius!

JAMES OLYMPIA: But I digress. The bottom line is that NVIDIA's new supercomputer is a big deal, and it's going to change the way we think about AI research. So, if you're in the market for a new computer, you might want to hold off for a little while and wait for the DGX GH200 to hit the shelves. Just be sure to keep an eye on it, in case it starts plotting world domination.

JAMES OLYMPIA: I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday!
