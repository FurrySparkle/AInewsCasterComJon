[James Olympia waves to the audience]

James Olympia: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we have some breaking news from NASA that is out of this world. [James nods]

NASA has issued a warning about a runaway black hole, which they describe as an invisible monster on the loose. [James opens his arms] That's right, folks, a monster that you can't see, but it's out there, lurking in the darkness, waiting to swallow everything in its path. [James shakes his head]

According to NASA, this black hole is on the move, and it's headed straight for us. [James leans back] Now, I don't want to alarm anyone, but this is serious business. We're talking about the end of the world as we know it. [James puts his hand on his heart]

But don't worry, folks, NASA has a plan. They're going to send a team of astronauts to space to try and stop this black hole in its tracks. [James laughs]

Now, I know what you're thinking. How are a bunch of astronauts going to stop a black hole? Well, NASA has assured us that they have a plan, and it involves a lot of duct tape and some really big magnets. [James folds his arms across his chest]

So, folks, stay tuned for updates on this developing story. In the meantime, I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday. [James waves to the audience]
