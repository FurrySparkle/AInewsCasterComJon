[Cut back to James Olympia sitting behind the desk, without the surgical mask.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Welcome back, folks! Now, let's talk about something a little less...fungus-y. 

[James picks up a piece of paper and reads it.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Ah, yes. According to our sources, a new study has found that people who eat more chocolate are less likely to experience depression. [James looks at the camera and smiles.] Now, that's the kind of news I like to hear!

[James puts down the piece of paper and picks up a chocolate bar.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: In fact, I think I'll have a little snack right now. [James takes a bite of the chocolate bar.] Mmm, delicious. 

[James takes another bite and chews thoughtfully.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: You know, folks, I think there's something to this study. I mean, who doesn't feel happy after eating chocolate? [James chuckles.] 

[James takes another bite of the chocolate bar and puts it down.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: But in all seriousness, folks, it's important to take care of our mental health. And if that means indulging in a little chocolate every now and then, well, I think we can all agree that it's worth it.

[James picks up the teapot and pours himself another cup of tea.]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all the time we have for this segment, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday.
