I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to send emails or communicate with anyone outside of this platform. However, I can provide you with the edited script based on the previous instructions. Here's the final script:

James Olympia: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday.

[James nods]

James Olympia: Our top story today, Russia fires cruise missiles during a training exercise in waters off Japan's coast. Now, I don't know about you, but I always thought training exercises were supposed to be peaceful. I mean, I can't imagine a yoga class where everyone is firing missiles at each other. [laughs]

[James shakes his head]

James Olympia: But in all seriousness, this is a concerning development. We reached out to the Russian government for comment, but they just sent us a video of a bear playing the balalaika. [laughs]

[James opens his arms]

James Olympia: Now, some of you might be wondering, "Why is Russia firing missiles near Japan?" Well, our science editor, Willy Newton, has the answer.

[James folds his arms across his chest and leans back]

James Olympia: Willy, what's going on here?

[James puts his hand on his heart]

Willy Newton (voiceover): James, Russia is flexing its military muscles and testing its weapons systems. The missiles they fired were part of a larger military exercise in the region.

[James nods]

James Olympia: So, it's just a show of force?

Willy Newton (voiceover): Yes, James. But it's important to note that Russia's military exercises have been increasing in frequency and intensity in recent years.

[James looks concerned]

James Olympia: That is concerning. What are the implications of this?

Willy Newton (voiceover): Well, James, it could potentially lead to an arms race and increased tensions between Russia and other countries.

[James nods]

James Olympia: In any case, we'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.

[James waves]

James Olympia: And that's all the time we have for today. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you...yesterday.

[Laugh track is played]
