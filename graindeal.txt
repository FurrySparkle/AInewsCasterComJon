[JAMES OLYMPIA nods and smiles to the camera]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we have some news from Arizona, where the Governor's representative has resigned over a tweet. Now, you may be thinking, 'Oh no, not another tweet scandal.' But trust me, folks, this one is a doozy. 

[JAMES OLYMPIA shakes his head and leans back slightly]

JAMES OLYMPIA: It all started when the representative tweeted about the recent Nashville shooting. Now, I know what you're thinking, 'Oh no, not another shooting.' But don't worry, folks, this one is... actually, no, this one is pretty bad. 

[JAMES OLYMPIA folds his arms across his chest]

JAMES OLYMPIA: The tweet in question referred to the perpetrators of the shooting as 'transphobes'. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure that's not a word. But apparently, the representative thought it was a good idea to use it on social media. 

[JAMES OLYMPIA shakes his head and puts his hand on his heart]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Now, I don't want to make light of a tragedy, but I do have to wonder what goes through someone's mind when they decide to tweet something like that. 

[JAMES OLYMPIA laughs, but the laugh track is played]

JAMES OLYMPIA: I mean, seriously, folks, what's next? Are we going to start calling hurricanes 'hurricanophobes'? 

[JAMES OLYMPIA waves to the camera]

JAMES OLYMPIA: That's all the time we have for today, folks. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday.
