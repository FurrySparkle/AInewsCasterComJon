JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Welcome to Yesterday Today, the show that knows what you
 need to know today, but yesterday. In international news today, Russia has agreed to extend the Ukraine grain deal again. [James nods his head] This is great news 
as it means that Ukraine will have a consistent supply of grain which they can turn into... whatever it is they do with grain. And as we all know, when Ukraine has 
grain, the world is a happier place. [James smiles]\n
\nBut enough about grain for now. It's time for a quick fact from our science editor, Willie Newton. Willie, tell
 us something exciting!\n
\n[Camera cuts to Willie, who is off-camera]\n
\nWILLIE NEWTON: Did you know that the amount of energy released when food is burned is exactly
 the same whether you burn it in a fireplace or a human digestive system? [laughs] Isn't that fascinating?\n
\n[Camera cuts back to James]\n\nJAMES OLYMPIA: That
 really is amazing, Willie. Thanks for sharing! [James leans back]\n
\nNow, let's get back to Russia and Ukraine. This deal extension does beg the question, though. 
How many extensions can one deal have before it expires? [James shakes his head]\n
\nWell, we reached out to our Accuracy Assurance Agent, Tony Bansya, to get his
 take on the matter. Tony has the sensibilities of Russel Brand and the accuracy of... well, nobody, really. [James winks]\n
\nBut before we can hear what Tony has
 to say, we have to take a quick break. When we come back, we'll hear Tony's thoughts, and we'll find out if Russia and Ukraine can keep this grain deal going 
forever. [James waves, and we cut to a commercial break]\n
\n[Coming back from the break]\n
\nJAMES OLYMPIA: Welcome back to Yesterday Today. We're talking about
 Russia extending the grain deal with Ukraine (again), and we have our Accuracy Assurance Agent, Tony Bansya, on the line now to give us his thoughts. 
Tony, what do you think?\n\n[James pauses. There's a laugh track played in the background. James leans forward to his desk, and there's a noticeable sound
 of arms and legs creaking as he does so]\n\nJAMES OLYMPIA: Oh, wait a minute. It looks like Tony is out sick today. So we'll just have to use our own best 
judgement. [James puts his hand on his heart]\n\nWell folks, it seems like this deal is going to be extended for a long time yet. [James raises his eyebrows] And
 as long as we all have bread on our tables, life is good. That's our show for today. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday! [James laughs and waves as
 we go to black.]",
