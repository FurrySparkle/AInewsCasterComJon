        \nJames Olympia: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today,
         the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today we have a shocking story from Russia. 
         The country has banned soundcloud rappers. [shakes his head]\n
         \nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"James, what's a soundcloud rapper?\"
          Well, it's a rapper who's music is primarily shared on the music-sharing platform Soundcloud. [nods]\n
          \nAccording to our sources, Russia has banned soundcloud rappers because they're a threat to national security. [opens his arms]\n
          \nNow, I don't know about you, but I've never felt threatened by a soundcloud rapper. In fact, I find their music quite soothing. [puts his hand on his heart]\n
          \nBut, apparently, the Russian government thinks differently. They believe that soundcloud rappers are a bad influence on the country's youth. 
          [fold his arms accross his chest]\n
          \nWe reached out to the Russian government for comment, but they declined to speak with us. [shrugs]\n
          \nNow, I have to say, this is a sad day for music lovers everywhere. But fear not, dear viewers, for there are still 
          plenty of great rappers out there who aren't on Soundcloud. [leans back]\n
          \nAnd that's all the time we have for today. I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday. [laugh track is played]",
