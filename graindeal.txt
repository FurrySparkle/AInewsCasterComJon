[JAMES OLYMPIA waves to the camera]

JAMES OLYMPIA: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today, the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we're talking about America's favorite pastime, baseball! [JAMES nods]

Now, I know what you're thinking, "James, you're a Brit, what do you know about baseball?" Well, let me tell you, I know just as much as any other Brit, which is to say, not a whole lot. [JAMES opens his arms]

But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the highlights and moments of MLB Opening Day! [JAMES shakes his head]

Let's start with the New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays. The Yankees won 3-2, but what I really want to talk about is this amazing catch by Yankees outfielder, Aaron Judge. [JAMES leans back]

[JAMES puts his hand on his heart]

Now, that's what I call a catch! And speaking of catches, how about this one by the San Francisco Giants' Mike Yastrzemski? [JAMES nods]

I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous! [JAMES laughs track is played]

And let's not forget about the Los Angeles Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, who became the first pitcher in MLB history to record 10 strikeouts on Opening Day four times. [JAMES folds his arms behind his head]

Now that's what I call a record! [JAMES shakes his head]

And finally, we have to talk about the Chicago Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs won 5-3, but what everyone's talking about is this incredible home run by Cubs first baseman, Anthony Rizzo. [JAMES nods]

[JAMES leans back]

Now, that's what I call a home run! [JAMES puts his hand on his heart]

And that's it for our MLB Opening Day highlights and moments. [JAMES folds his arms across his chest] I'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday!
