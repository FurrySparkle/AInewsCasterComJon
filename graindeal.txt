        \nJames Olympia: Greetings! Greetings! It's me, James Olympia, and you're watching Yesterday Today,
         the show that tells you what you need to know today, but yesterday. Today, we've got some exciting news from the world of military exercises. 
         Russia has fired cruise missiles during a training exercise in waters off Japan's coast. [James nods]\n\
         nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"James, that sounds like a dangerous situation.\" But let's be real, folks,
          it's just Russia showing off their fancy toys to Japan. [James folds his arms across his chest] \n
          \nOur accuracy assurance agent, Tony Bansya, has confirmed that no one was hurt in the exercise, so we can all relax and enjoy the show. [James leans back]\n 
          \nBut let's not forget the real star of this story, those cruise missiles. Our science editor, Willy Newton, has informed me that cruise missiles are guided
           missiles that are designed to travel long distances at low altitude. [James puts his hand on his heart]\n\
           nNow, I don't know about you, but that sounds like something I could use in my daily commute. [laugh track is played]\n\
           nOur AI consultant, Chad Gary Paul Trimbly, has also informed me that these missiles are often equipped with artificial intelligence, 
           which means they can make decisions on their own. [James shakes his head]\n
           \nNow, I don't know about you folks, but I don't trust anything that can make decisions on its own.
            That's how we end up with killer robots. [laugh track is played]\n
            \nIn conclusion, folks, Russia fired some missiles, no one was hurt, and we all got a little bit smarter. [James folds his arms behind his head] \n
            \nI'm James Olympia, and I'll see you... yesterday. [James waves to the audience as the show ends]",
